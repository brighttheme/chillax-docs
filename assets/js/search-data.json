The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ### Check the Youtube video tutorial {: .no_toc } --- ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. --- ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives --- ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents. It is possible to enable it, but it might need some tinkering. In the `autocomplete-plus` settings, make sure that Markdown files aren't blacklisted. Additionally, it might help to switch the default provider to Fuzzy. For Atom to index your Markdown documents as symbols, you have to add the following to your `config.cson`: ```coffee '.text.md': autocomplete: symbols: constant: selector: \"*\" typePriority: 1 ``` You can find additional information in [this issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/150). --- ## Syntax-highlighting is broken after uninstall The core-package `language-gfm` is automatically disabled (unless you've enabled the setting that prevents this) when using `language-markdown` to avoid any conflicts. Because `language-markdown` is intended as a drop-in replacement you most likely won't need both anyway. However, if you uninstall `language-markdown`, `language-gfm` doesn't automatically get re-activated. There's no API available to do this, so you'll have to re-activate `language-gfm` manually, which is quite easy. 1. Open the \"Settings\" and go to the \"Packages\" tab 2. Search for `language-gfm` 3. Click `Enable` to re-activate it 4. You probably want to reload Atom to make sure the change takes effect --- ## Trailing whitespace is automatically removed, but I don't want that By default, Atom removes all trailing whitespace when a file is saved. You can disable it by setting the following flag in your `config.cson` for the `.md.text` scope. For more background, see [#115](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/115). ```coffee '*': # all current config '.md.text': whitespace: removeTrailingWhitespace: false ``` ## Spell-check doesn't work; how do I enable it? The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents.

    "title": "Search",
    "content": "# Search {: .no_toc } ## {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- Just the Docs uses [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com) to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates. All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page). By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points: - Page title - Page content - Page URL ## Enable search in configuration In your site's `_config.yml`, enable search: ```yaml # Enable or disable the site search # Supports true (default) or false search_enabled: true ``` ### Search granularity Pages are split into sections that can be searched individually. The sections are defined by the headings on the page. Each section is displayed in a separate search result. ```yaml # Split pages into sections that can be searched individually # Supports 1 - 6, default: 2 search.heading_level: 2 ``` ### Search previews A search result can contain previews that show where the search words are found in the specific section. ```yaml # Maximum amount of previews per search result # Default: 3 search.previews: 3 # Maximum amount of words to display before a matched word in the preview # Default: 5 search.preview_words_before: 5 # Maximum amount of words to display after a matched word in the preview # Default: 10 search.preview_words_after: 10 ``` ### Search tokenizer The default is for hyphens to separate tokens in search terms: `gem-based` is equivalent to `gem based`, matching either word. To allow search for hyphenated words: ```yaml # Set the search token separator # Default: /[\\s\\-/]+/ # Example: enable support for hyphenated search words search.tokenizer_separator: /[\\s/]+/ ``` ### Display URL in search results ```yaml # Display the relative url in search results # Supports true (default) or false search.rel_url: false ``` ### Display search button The search button displays in the bottom right corner of the screen and triggers the search input when clicked. ```yaml # Enable or disable the search button that appears in the bottom right corner of every page # Supports true or false (default) search.button: true ``` ## Hiding pages from search Sometimes you might have a page that you don't want to be indexed for the search nor to show up in search results, e.g, a 404 page. To exclude a page from search, add the `search_exclude: true` parameter to the page's YAML front matter: #### Example {: .no_toc } ```yaml --- layout: default title: Page not found nav_exclude: true search_exclude: true --- ``` ## Generate search index when used as a gem If you use Just the Docs as a remote theme, you do not need the following steps. If you use the theme as a gem, you must initialize the search by running this `rake` command that comes with `just-the-docs`: ```bash $ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init ``` This command creates the `assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json` file that Jekyll uses to create your search index. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with [this content]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json). ",

The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ### Check the Youtube video tutorial {: .no_toc } --- ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. --- ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives --- ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents. It is possible to enable it, but it might need some tinkering. In the `autocomplete-plus` settings, make sure that Markdown files aren't blacklisted. Additionally, it might help to switch the default provider to Fuzzy. For Atom to index your Markdown documents as symbols, you have to add the following to your `config.cson`: ```coffee '.text.md': autocomplete: symbols: constant: selector: \"*\" typePriority: 1 ``` You can find additional information in [this issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/150). --- ## Syntax-highlighting is broken after uninstall The core-package `language-gfm` is automatically disabled (unless you've enabled the setting that prevents this) when using `language-markdown` to avoid any conflicts. Because `language-markdown` is intended as a drop-in replacement you most likely won't need both anyway. However, if you uninstall `language-markdown`, `language-gfm` doesn't automatically get re-activated. There's no API available to do this, so you'll have to re-activate `language-gfm` manually, which is quite easy. 1. Open the \"Settings\" and go to the \"Packages\" tab 2. Search for `language-gfm` 3. Click `Enable` to re-activate it 4. You probably want to reload Atom to make sure the change takes effect --- ## Trailing whitespace is automatically removed, but I don't want that By default, Atom removes all trailing whitespace when a file is saved. You can disable it by setting the following flag in your `config.cson` for the `.md.text` scope. For more background, see [#115](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/115). ```coffee '*': # all current config '.md.text': whitespace: removeTrailingWhitespace: false ``` ## Spell-check doesn't work; how do I enable it?

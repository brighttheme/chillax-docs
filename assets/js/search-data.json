    "content": "# Frequently Asked Questions {: .no_toc } {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- ## Spell-check doesn't work; how do I enable it? The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents. It is possible to enable it, but it might need some tinkering. In the `autocomplete-plus` settings, make sure that Markdown files aren't blacklisted. Additionally, it might help to switch the default provider to Fuzzy. For Atom to index your Markdown documents as symbols, you have to add the following to your `config.cson`: ```coffee '.text.md': autocomplete: symbols: constant: selector: \"*\" typePriority: 1 ``` You can find additional information in [this issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/150). ## Syntax-highlighting is broken after uninstall The core-package `language-gfm` is automatically disabled (unless you've enabled the setting that prevents this) when using `language-markdown` to avoid any conflicts. Because `language-markdown` is intended as a drop-in replacement you most likely won't need both anyway. However, if you uninstall `language-markdown`, `language-gfm` doesn't automatically get re-activated. There's no API available to do this, so you'll have to re-activate `language-gfm` manually, which is quite easy. 1. Open the \"Settings\" and go to the \"Packages\" tab 2. Search for `language-gfm` 3. Click `Enable` to re-activate it 4. You probably want to reload Atom to make sure the change takes effect ## Trailing whitespace is automatically removed, but I don't want that By default, Atom removes all trailing whitespace when a file is saved. You can disable it by setting the following flag in your `config.cson` for the `.md.text` scope. For more background, see [#115](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/115). ```coffee '*': # all current config '.md.text': whitespace: removeTrailingWhitespace: false ``` ## Utilities CSS utility classes come in handy when you to want to override default styles to create additional whitespace (margins/padding), correct unexpected shifts in font size or weight, add color, or hide (or show) something at a specific screen size. {: .fs-6 .fw-300 } If you want to embed images, this is how you do it: ![Image of Yaktocat](https://olania-jekyll.netlify.app/images/37.jpg) [![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iGWQxXVxttQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGWQxXVxttQ \"Video Title\") ",

As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1] > The overriding design goal for Markdown's > formatting syntax is to make it as readable > as possible. The idea is that a > Markdown-formatted document should be > publishable as-is, as plain text, without > looking like it's been marked up with tags > or formatting instructions. This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right. ### Tech Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly: * [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps! * [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor * [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend. * [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps * [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend * [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk] * [Gulp] - the streaming build system * [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter * [jQuery] - duh And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub. ### Installation Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server. ```sh $ cd dillinger $ npm install -d $ node app ``` For production environments... ```sh $ npm install --production $ NODE_ENV=production node app ``` ### Plugins Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below. | Plugin | README | ------ | ------ | Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] | GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] | Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] | OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] | Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] | Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] | ### Development Want to contribute? Great! Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing. Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates! Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands. First Tab: ```sh $ node app ``` Second Tab: ```sh $ gulp watch ``` (optional) Third: ```sh $ karma test ``` #### Building for source For production release: ```sh $ gulp build --prod ``` Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution: ```sh $ gulp build dist --prod ``` ### Docker Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image. ```sh cd dillinger docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} . ``` This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger. Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile): ```sh docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=\"always\" /dillinger:${package.json.version} ``` Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser. ```sh 127.0.0.1:8000 ``` #### Kubernetes + Google Cloud See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md) ### Todos - Write MORE Tests - Add Night Mode License ---- MIT **Free Software, Hell Yeah!** ### (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.

To enable a color scheme, set the `color_scheme` parameter in your site's `_config.yml` file: ![Image of Yaktocat](https://olania-jekyll.netlify.app/images/37.jpg) [![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iGWQxXVxttQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGWQxXVxttQ \"Video Title\") ### Test Youtube video #### Example {: .no_toc } ```yaml # Color scheme supports \"light\" (default) and \"dark\" color_scheme: dark ``` Preview dark color scheme ## Custom schemes ### Define a custom scheme You can add custom schemes. If you want to add a scheme named `foo` (can be any name) just add a file `_sass/color_schemes/foo.scss` (replace `foo` by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Available variables are listed in the [_variables.scss](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/tree/master/_sass/support/_variables.scss) file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: #### Example {: .no_toc } ```scss $link-color: $blue-000; ``` _Note:_ Editing the variables directly in `_sass/support/variables.scss` is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. ### Use a custom scheme To use the custom color scheme, only set the `color_scheme` parameter in your site's `_config.yml` file: ```yaml color_scheme: foo ``` ### Switchable custom scheme If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file `assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss` (replace `foo` by your scheme name) with the following content:` {% raw %} --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} {% endraw %} This allows you to switch the scheme via the following javascript. ```js jtd.setTheme('foo'); ``` ## Override and completely custom styles For styles that aren't defined as variables, you may want to modify specific CSS classes. Additionally, you may want to add completely custom CSS specific to your content. To do this, put your styles in the file `_sass/custom/custom.scss`. This will allow for all overrides to be kept in a single file, and for any upstream changes to still be applied. For example, if you'd like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles. #### Example {: .no_toc } ```scss // Print-only styles. @media print { .side-bar, .page-header { display: none; } .main-content { max-width: auto; margin: 1em;} } ``` ",

The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ### Check the Youtube video tutorial {: .no_toc } --- ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. --- ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives --- ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents. It is possible to enable it, but it might need some tinkering. In the `autocomplete-plus` settings, make sure that Markdown files aren't blacklisted. Additionally, it might help to switch the default provider to Fuzzy. For Atom to index your Markdown documents as symbols, you have to add the following to your `config.cson`: ```coffee '.text.md': autocomplete: symbols: constant: selector: \"*\" typePriority: 1 ``` You can find additional information in [this issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/150). --- ## Syntax-highlighting is broken after uninstall The core-package `language-gfm` is automatically disabled (unless you've enabled the setting that prevents this) when using `language-markdown` to avoid any conflicts. Because `language-markdown` is intended as a drop-in replacement you most likely won't need both anyway. However, if you uninstall `language-markdown`, `language-gfm` doesn't automatically get re-activated. There's no API available to do this, so you'll have to re-activate `language-gfm` manually, which is quite easy. 1. Open the \"Settings\" and go to the \"Packages\" tab 2. Search for `language-gfm` 3. Click `Enable` to re-activate it 4. You probably want to reload Atom to make sure the change takes effect --- ## Trailing whitespace is automatically removed, but I don't want that By default, Atom removes all trailing whitespace when a file is saved. You can disable it by setting the following flag in your `config.cson` for the `.md.text` scope. For more background, see [#115](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/115). ```coffee '*': # all current config '.md.text': whitespace: removeTrailingWhitespace: false ``` ",

    "content": "# Search {: .no_toc } ## {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- Just the Docs uses [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com) to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates. All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page). By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points: - Page title - Page content - Page URL ## Enable search in configuration In your site's `_config.yml`, enable search: ```yaml # Enable or disable the site search # Supports true (default) or false search_enabled: true ``` ### Search granularity Pages are split into sections that can be searched individually. The sections are defined by the headings on the page. Each section is displayed in a separate search result. ```yaml # Split pages into sections that can be searched individually # Supports 1 - 6, default: 2 search.heading_level: 2 ``` ### Search previews A search result can contain previews that show where the search words are found in the specific section. ```yaml # Maximum amount of previews per search result # Default: 3 search.previews: 3 # Maximum amount of words to display before a matched word in the preview # Default: 5 search.preview_words_before: 5 # Maximum amount of words to display after a matched word in the preview # Default: 10 search.preview_words_after: 10 ``` ### Search tokenizer The default is for hyphens to separate tokens in search terms: `gem-based` is equivalent to `gem based`, matching either word. To allow search for hyphenated words: ```yaml # Set the search token separator # Default: /[\\s\\-/]+/ # Example: enable support for hyphenated search words search.tokenizer_separator: /[\\s/]+/ ``` ### Display URL in search results ```yaml # Display the relative url in search results # Supports true (default) or false search.rel_url: false ``` ### Display search button The search button displays in the bottom right corner of the screen and triggers the search input when clicked. ```yaml # Enable or disable the search button that appears in the bottom right corner of every page # Supports true or false (default) search.button: true ``` ## Hiding pages from search Sometimes you might have a page that you don't want to be indexed for the search nor to show up in search results, e.g, a 404 page. To exclude a page from search, add the `search_exclude: true` parameter to the page's YAML front matter: #### Example {: .no_toc } ```yaml --- layout: default title: Page not found nav_exclude: true search_exclude: true --- ``` ## Generate search index when used as a gem If you use Just the Docs as a remote theme, you do not need the following steps. If you use the theme as a gem, you must initialize the search by running this `rake` command that comes with `just-the-docs`: ```bash $ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init ``` This command creates the `assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json` file that Jekyll uses to create your search index. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with [this content]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/assets/js/zzzz-search-data.json). ",

The core-package `spell-check` doesn't scan documents in the `text.md` by default. You can easily add this yourself: - Open the Atom settings, and find the Packages tab - Search for the `spell-check` package; you can find it under the Core Packages - Open the settings for `spell-check` - Append `text.md` to the list of grammars (make sure the scopes are comma-separated) - Reload Atom to make sure the updated settings take effect ## Some of my Markdown elements aren't highlighted `language-markdown` parses your Markdown document; it does not directly color the different elements. This is done by the syntax-theme you are using. There's a good chance that your syntax-theme doesn't support all the different elements that `language-markdown` recognizes. You can ask the author of the theme to add better support for `language-markdown`, or [add styles to your custom stylesheet](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks). You can also try one of the tried and tested syntax-themes featured above. If you can't get it to work, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/), and I'll see what I can do. ## Which elements of Markdown are supported? Because there is no clear Markdown standard, I've chosen to follow the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/) as closely as possible within the Atom environment. On top of that, I've implemented support for a few extensions: Github Flavored Markdown, Markdown Extra, CriticMark, Front Matter, and R Markdown. Together, I believe these specs cover a solid 98% of your day-to-day Markdown needs. If you feel that an element is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/new/). #### Notes on implementation {: .no_toc } - Raw `html` is included when you have the default `language-html` grammar enabled - The Github Flavored `task-lists` are implemented as part of 'normal' `lists` - Setext-headers (underlined-headers) are not supported - `indented-code-blocks` have been disabled to prevent false-positives; use `fenced-code-blocks` instead ([more details](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/88#issuecomment-183344420)) - Github tables require pipes at the start of each line, and cells need a padding of at least one space; this is a suggested convention to prevent false positives ## Autocompletion doesn't work Autocompletion doesn't work out-of-the-box with Markdown documents. It is possible to enable it, but it might need some tinkering. In the `autocomplete-plus` settings, make sure that Markdown files aren't blacklisted. Additionally, it might help to switch the default provider to Fuzzy. For Atom to index your Markdown documents as symbols, you have to add the following to your `config.cson`: ```coffee '.text.md': autocomplete: symbols: constant: selector: \"*\" typePriority: 1 ``` You can find additional information in [this issue](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/150). ## Syntax-highlighting is broken after uninstall The core-package `language-gfm` is automatically disabled (unless you've enabled the setting that prevents this) when using `language-markdown` to avoid any conflicts. Because `language-markdown` is intended as a drop-in replacement you most likely won't need both anyway. However, if you uninstall `language-markdown`, `language-gfm` doesn't automatically get re-activated. There's no API available to do this, so you'll have to re-activate `language-gfm` manually, which is quite easy. 1. Open the \"Settings\" and go to the \"Packages\" tab 2. Search for `language-gfm` 3. Click `Enable` to re-activate it 4. You probably want to reload Atom to make sure the change takes effect ## Trailing whitespace is automatically removed, but I don't want that By default, Atom removes all trailing whitespace when a file is saved. You can disable it by setting the following flag in your `config.cson` for the `.md.text` scope. For more background, see [#115](https://github.com/burodepeper/language-markdown/issues/115). ```coffee '*': # all current config '.md.text': whitespace: removeTrailingWhitespace: false ``` ## Utilities CSS utility classes come in handy when you to want to override default styles to create additional whitespace (margins/padding), correct unexpected shifts in font size or weight, add color, or hide (or show) something at a specific screen size. {: .fs-6 .fw-300 } If you want to embed images, this is how you do it: ![Image of Yaktocat](https://olania-jekyll.netlify.app/images/37.jpg) [![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iGWQxXVxttQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGWQxXVxttQ \"Video Title\") ",

As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1] > The overriding design goal for Markdown's > formatting syntax is to make it as readable > as possible. The idea is that a > Markdown-formatted document should be > publishable as-is, as plain text, without > looking like it's been marked up with tags > or formatting instructions. This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right. ### Tech Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly: * [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps! * [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor * [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend. * [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps * [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend * [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk] * [Gulp] - the streaming build system * [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter * [jQuery] - duh And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub. ### Installation Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server. ```sh $ cd dillinger $ npm install -d $ node app ``` For production environments... ```sh $ npm install --production $ NODE_ENV=production node app ``` ### Plugins Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below. | Plugin | README | ------ | ------ | Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] | GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] | Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] | OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] | Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] | Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] | ### Development Want to contribute? Great! Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing. Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates! Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands. First Tab: ```sh $ node app ``` Second Tab: ```sh $ gulp watch ``` (optional) Third: ```sh $ karma test ``` #### Building for source For production release: ```sh $ gulp build --prod ``` Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution: ```sh $ gulp build dist --prod ``` ### Docker Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container. By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image. ```sh cd dillinger docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} . ``` This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger. Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile): ```sh docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=\"always\" /dillinger:${package.json.version} ``` Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser. ```sh 127.0.0.1:8000 ``` #### Kubernetes + Google Cloud See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md) ### Todos - Write MORE Tests - Add Night Mode License ---- MIT **Free Software, Hell Yeah!** ### (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
